# UI/UX

These two terms stand for *User Interface* and *User Experience*. While the
first one is mainly concerned with the layout of application elements, the
latter one cares about how the interaction with the application feels to the user.

Both terms are linked to each other and highly influence the user acceptance of
the finished application/product.

## Case Study: Plone Commander

[Plone Commander](/portfolio/plone-commander/#content) offers an alternative UI
for the CMS [Plone](http://plone.org). The application follows a modern mobile
first approach using [ExtJS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs).
