# Overview

The RIDING BYTES website is based on a general-purpose website framework called
[Hugo]. Unlike systems like WordPress, Ghost and Drupal, [Hugo] doesnâ€™t depend
on administrative privileges, databases, runtimes, interpreters or external
libraries. It creates the website only once, when you create new content.


## About

Sites built with [Hugo] are extremely fast and very secure. [Hugo] sites can be
hosted anywhere, including [Heroku], [GoDaddy], [DreamHost], [GitHub Pages],
[Google Cloud Storage], [Amazon S3] and [CloudFront], and work well with CDNs.
[Hugo] sites run without dependencies on expensive runtimes like Ruby, Python or
PHP and without dependencies on any databases.
